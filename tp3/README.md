## Project information

The checkers game is played on tp2's scene. It adds all the game features and customizations, shared between the controls menu and the game table, where the game is being played.

### Strong Points

- Game is very well integrated visually on the scene, and very appealing
- Another custom traversal of the component tree for performance optimization, this time in order to carry out the *spritesheets* technique
- Cubic easing on the pieces' movement animations
- Press-down animation on the undo/lock buttons
- Automatic highlighting of chained moves after the first one

### Scene

- A marble platform
- A sandbox
- A bench
- A slide
- An up-and-down
- A swing
- 3 distinct trees
- Several decorative rocks
- A hammock
- A beehive
- Several bees
- A game table
  - A checkers board
  - Auxiliary boards
  - Marker boards
- Wood posters announcing each player's victory
- 3 distinct seasons ([winter](screenshots/winter_moody.png), [spring](screenshots/spring_moody.png) and [autumn](screenshots/autumn_moody.png))
- Lights on the sandbox to give a [darker/night feel to the scene](screenshots/autumn_moody.png)
