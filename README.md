## Projects

### [TP1 - Scene Graph](tp1)

The scene portrays a low-poly outdoors playground. It has a marble platform supporting a sandbox, a bench, a slide, an up-and-down and a swing, as well as some decorative trees and rocks.

#### Strong Points

- Engaging visuals, with 3 different scene 'seasons'
- Randomly generated convex triangle spheres using our Python script allows for believable low-poly trees
- Uses a primitive multiplexer, allowing for no updates to texCoords to be made on display, which significantly improves performance when applying textures to primitives with different length_v and length_u parameters
- Takes special care of texture wraping
