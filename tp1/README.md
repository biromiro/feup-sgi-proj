## Project information

Our scene portrays a low-poly outdoors playground. It has a marble platform supporting a sandbox, a bench, a slide, an up-and-down and a swing, as well as some decorative trees and rocks.

### Strong Points
- Engaging visuals
- Randomly generated convex triangle spheres using our Python script allows for believable low-poly trees
- Uses a primitive multiplexer, allowing for no updates to texCoords to be made on display, which significantly improves performance when applying textures to primitives with different length_v and length_u parameters
- Takes special care of texture wraping
- 3 different scene 'seasons', each with its own personalized color pallete
- Scene composed by several different components, which make it quite complex and interesting
